      "\n",
      "1. **Blue Whale**: The blue whale is the largest animal on Earth, with some individuals reaching lengths of up to 100 feet (30 meters). They can also be heard from over 10 miles (16 kilometers) away, as their songs can travel that far underwater!\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Octopus**: Octopuses have three hearts, which pump blue-green blood throughout their bodies. They also have nine brains – one for each arm, plus a central brain! Talk about being well-connected!\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Sea Turtles**: Sea turtles have been on our planet for over 100 million years, making them one of the oldest species on Earth. They can also migrate thousands of miles each year to reach their breeding grounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Clownfish**: Clownfish are born male and can actually change sex to become females if the dominant female in their group dies. This unique trait is called sequential hermaphroditism.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Jellyfish**: Jellyfish have been around for over 650 million years, making them one of the oldest living things on the planet. They also have a unique way of moving through the water, using a process called \"jet propulsion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Dolphins**: Dolphins are highly social animals that live in groups called pods. They have been observed showing empathy and self-awareness, and have even been known to help other animals, including humans, in distress.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Squid**: Squid have the largest eyes of any animal on the planet, with some species having eyes that are up to 10 inches (25 centimeters) in diameter. They can also change the color and texture of their skin to blend in with their surroundings.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Sharks**: Sharks have been on the planet for over 400 million years, and have been around since before dinosaurs roamed the Earth. They also have a special sense called \"electroreception,\" which allows them to detect the electrical signals of other animals.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Sea Stars**: Sea stars, also known as starfish, have the unique ability to regrow their arms if they're injured or attacked. They can also move using a process called \"wave-like motion,\" where they contract and relax their muscles to create a slow, wavelike movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Anglerfish**: Anglerfish have a special organ on their head that's used as a lure to attract prey. This organ is called an \"illicium,\" and it's often used to catch fish and other small animals that swim too close.\n",

      "2. Bass Guitar: A slapping, funky bassline to add depth and energy to the track.\n",
      "3. Drums: A mix of acoustic and electronic drums to create a dynamic, pulsing rhythm.\n",
      "4. Keyboards/Synths: Adding a touch of tropical flavor with bright, shimmering synths and a hint of retro flair.\n",
      "5. Percussion: Incorporating traditional Latin American percussion elements like congas, bongos, and shakers to give the song a lively, island feel.\n",
      "6. Horns: Adding a splash of color with a trumpet or saxophone solo to punctuate key moments in the song.\n",
      "7. Strings: A subtle, atmospheric string section to enhance the emotional impact of the lyrics and add a sense of grandeur.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Production Tips:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Use a moderate tempo (around 110-115 BPM) to create a sense of movement and energy.\n",
      "2. Experiment with different time signatures to create a sense of tension and release.\n",
      "3. Add a touch of reverb and delay to the vocals to give them a sense of space and depth.\n",
      "4. Use the horns and percussion to create a sense of build and release, particularly during the choruses.\n",
      "5. Consider adding a brief, atmospheric instrumental break (like the \"drum solo\" in the original lyrics) to give the song a sense of breathing room.\n",
