      "1. **Blue Whale**: The blue whale is the largest animal that has ever lived on Earth, with some individuals reaching lengths of up to 100 feet (30 meters). Fun fact: Despite their massive size, blue whales can dive as deep as 3,000 feet (914 meters) in search of food!\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Octopus**: With over 300 species, octopuses are one of the most diverse groups of animals in the ocean. Fun fact: Octopuses have three hearts, which pump blue-green blood through their bodies!\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Sea Turtles**: These slow-moving reptiles have been on the planet for over 100 million years. Fun fact: Sea turtles can live up to 80 years in the wild, making them one of the longest-living vertebrates on the planet!\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Jellyfish**: With their stinging tentacles, jellyfish are often feared by humans. Fun fact: Jellyfish have been around for over 650 million years, making them one of the oldest animal groups on the planet!\n",

      "5. **Dolphins**: These intelligent mammals are known for their playful behavior. Fun fact: Dolphins have their own signature whistles, which serve as a form of identification and communication!\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Squid**: These cephalopods are often mistaken for octopuses, but they're actually a different species. Fun fact: Squid have the largest eyes of any animal on the planet, with some species having eyes that are up to 10 inches (25 cm) in diameter!\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Clownfish**: These brightly colored fish are made famous by the movie Finding Nemo. Fun fact: Clownfish are sequential hermaphrodites, meaning they start as males and can change sex to become females if the dominant female in their group dies!\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Sharks**: With over 500 species, sharks are one of the most diverse groups of fish in the ocean. Fun fact: Sharks have been on the planet for over 400 million years, long before humans!\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Sea Stars**: These slow-moving animals are often found in shallow waters. Fun fact: Sea stars have the ability to regrow their arms if they're injured or attacked by predators!\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Corals**: These tiny animals are responsible for creating the world's largest ecosystem. Fun fact: Corals are actually tiny animals called polyps, which are related to sea anemones and jellyfish!\n",
