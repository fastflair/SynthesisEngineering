Then, when a doctor gives an injection to a patient he/she believes that the patient is receiving something good, it's important to say that the vast majority of the doctors are actually good people, who are concerned and care about their patients, but they are kept in ignorance with regard to the content of the vaccines.\n",

    "Then, personally, at this precise moment, I would not receive any vaccine offered to me at all, not until the system changes, I want to be positive on this issue, but until these evil people are removed from their positions of power, the medical system cleared out and we are informed on what exactly these injections have, what they have put in the food and drinking water, I cannot accept it.  \n",
